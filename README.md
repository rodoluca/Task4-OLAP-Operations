# Task4 - OLAP Operations

### Project Description:
Perform OLAP operations (Drill Down, Rollup, Cube, Slice, and Dice) on the
"sales_sample" table to analyze sales data.

The project will include the following tasks:

### 1.Database Creation
a) Create a database to store the sales data (Redshift or PostgreSQL).

b)Create a table named "sales_sample" with the specified columns:
  - Product_Id (Integer)
  
  - Region (varchar(50))-like East ,West etc
  
  - Date (Date)
  
  - Sales_Amount (int/numeric)

### 2.Data Creation
a) Insert 10 sample records into the "sales_sample" table, representing sales data.

### 3.Perform OLAP operations
a) Drill Down-Analyze sales data at a more detailed level. Write a query to perform drill down from region to product level to understand sales performance.

b) Rollup- To summarize sales data at different levels of granularity. Write a query to perform roll up from product to region level to view total sales by region.

c) Cube - To analyze sales data from multiple dimensions simultaneously. Write a query to explore sales data from different perspectives, such as product, region and date.

d) Slice- To extract a subset of data based on specific criteria. Write a query to slice the data to view sales for a particular region or date range.

e) Dice - To extract data based on multiple criteria. Write a query to view sales for specific combinations of product, region, and date
